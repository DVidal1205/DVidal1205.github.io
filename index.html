          <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer + Computer Science Student</h2>
          <img src="images/self-portrait.jpg" alt="self-portrait" id="self-portrait">
          <p>Recently graduating from a program that allows me to attain an Associate Degree at 18 with full-time dual-enrollment, I have found a unique passion for software engineering, machine learning, and higher level mathematics. In the past few semesters, I have taken on rigorous programming courses and found both talent and joy in the subject. Hoping to become a back-end developer or machine learning engineer, I continue to strive for academic excellence and career readiness in the field.</p>
          <p>I am planning on continuing my academic pursuits at the University of Central Florida starting in the Fall 2023 semester (Go Knights!). There, I plan on participating in machine learning research and a handful of internships.</p>
